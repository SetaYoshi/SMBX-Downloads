The ninja bomberman character is needed to play the level. 
If you don't remember who he is, the level automatically switches you to him (for your convenience)

Please enjoy the level, and yes, it is all vanilla

POEM:

O' hotel king, bearer of keys
Many choices, but what is right for me
Something cheap, something nice
Something to spend in the night

It's been a long day, now I want it my way
Its wet outside, with skies of gray
I want my bed, to rest in the starlight
Hand me the key, and tell me goodnight
