Sednaiur for his SMW dark castle tileset.
Lx xZit for his Thwimp script.
The guy named "GreenMario" for his "Block Switching like in SMG but jumping instead" script.

Level specifications
The level can be played with any characters and may be Link but due to his speed and "accuracy", it makes the level semi-unplayable for him. I recommend playing as Toad because of his speed and his fireball "bounce height".
Difficulty: 1/2 star difficulty =/= Semi-easy *shrugs*
The level itself, may take a long time to load due to the number of blocks, NPCs, whatsoever and possible lags may occur.
